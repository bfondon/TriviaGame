**Synopsis**

This game was developed as a submission for homework assignment 5 during the October 2018-February 2019 coding bootcamp at UT Austin. It is meant to be a trivia game to challenge some basic knowledge of the Harry Potter books and films. The user hase 2.5 minutes to answer 10 questions before being alerted that time has passed.

The game was built using html, CSS, and Javascript. 


**Difficulties**
I spent a considerable portion of the total time trying to get my timing events to function as expected, with little luck. Unfortunately a late start to the assignment, combined with various roadblocks hampered the completion and styling of the game. As for actual game functionality, I was also having issues with my timer failing to stop when time remaining reached 0m 0s, and I was having issues with running an if function that appropriately incremented correct/incorrect answer variables and displayed them once the form was submitted.
